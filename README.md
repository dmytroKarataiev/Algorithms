# Algorithms
* Algorithms I've studied and implemented.

## Algorithms in the repository

### Easy
* [Sum a + b](a_plus_b)
* [Fibonacci](fibonacci), [Fibonacci last digit.](fibonacci_last_digit)
* [GCD](gcd), [LCM](lcm)
* [Simple greedy algorithms (money change, covering segments, different summands, fractional knapsack)](Greedy)

### Medium
* [Weighted Union Find algorithm to solve physical problem of movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials](Percolation)
* [Fibonacci huge mod m](fibonacci_huge)

## Future development
* Most common sorting, searching algorithms.
* Data Structures.
